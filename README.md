In this code i find distance from the Latitude and Longitude for 10 branches. to find the distance i use radiant formula = acos(sin(lat1)*sin(lat2)+cos(lat1)*cos(lat2)*cos(lon2-lon1))*6371 (6371 is Earth radius in km.)
Than i sort all the location with the start location (uttara branch).
And show the output based on the distance.
